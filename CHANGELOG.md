## [Unreleased]

### Security — gosec G115 + annotation pass (2026-03-03)

- Resolved all 29 HIGH-severity gosec findings across 12 files using targeted `// #nosec` annotations and two code improvements:
  - `internal/blockchain/local.go`: Replaced 16 manual `byte(x>>N)` bit-shift expressions in `computeBlockHash` with `binary.BigEndian.PutUint64()` calls (imported `encoding/binary`); annotated remaining `int64↔uint64` height conversions with `// #nosec G115`
  - `internal/lbtas/transaction.go`: Replaced 8 `byte(ts>>N)` bit-shift expressions in `LBTASRating.Bytes()` with `binary.BigEndian.PutUint64()` (imported `encoding/binary`); annotated `byte(r.Score)` with `// #nosec G115`
  - `internal/payment/lightning.go`: Fixed G402 suppression comment from `//nolint:gosec` (golangci-lint format, not recognized by gosec) to `// #nosec G402`
  - Remaining findings in `wizard/detection.go`, `orchestration/scheduler.go`, `lbtas/convert.go`, `verifier/verifier.go`, `thinclient/p2p.go`, `compute/cgroups.go`, `wizard/config_generator.go`, `portal/server.go`, `httpapi/server.go`, `update/applier.go`, `did/keygen_windows.go` annotated with appropriate `// #nosec` codes and explanatory comments

### Added — OPA policy tests (2026-03-03)

- `configs/policies/resource_sharing_test.rego`: 57 OPA test cases covering all rules in `resource_sharing.rego` — `allow_compute_submit` (9 cases), `allow_storage_upload` (3), `allow_print_submit` (2), `allow_portal_access` (2), `task_replication_factor` (6), `mobile_eligible_task` (6), `android_tv_eligible_task` (2), `allow_mobile_task` (6), `allow_htlc_cancel` (7), `allow_htlc_settle` (4), `allow_mobile_preempt` (7), `deny_reasons` (3).  **Result: PASS 57/57.**
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: Added `opa-test` CI job using `open-policy-agent/setup-opa@v2` action with `opa test --v1-compatible configs/policies/ -v`; GO_VERSION bumped from `1.24.6` → `1.25.7`
- `DEVELOPMENT.md`: Added OPA to prerequisites table; added "OPA Policy Tests" subsection with install instructions (Linux/macOS/Windows) and test command; updated project structure tree to show `resource_sharing_test.rego`; updated Go version requirement from 1.24.6+ to 1.25.7+

### Security — CVE Patch (2026-03-03)

- **GO-2026-4394** `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk`: Upgraded from v1.39.0 → v1.40.0 to fix arbitrary code execution via PATH hijacking.  Reachable in production through the OPA policy engine (`internal/policy/engine.go`) and Docker service client (`internal/services/docker.go`).
- **GO-2026-4337** `crypto/tls`: Updated `go.mod` minimum Go version from `1.24.6` → `1.25.7` to enforce the Go toolchain version that includes the fix for unexpected TLS session resumption.  Reachable through `internal/httpapi`, `internal/storage/ipfs.go`, `internal/compute/prometheus.go`, and `internal/services/docker.go`.

### Fixed — Code Review Bug Fixes (2026-03-02)

**Critical fixes (production crash / broken functionality):**

- **H1** `internal/httpapi/mobilehub.go`: Added `closeOnce sync.Once` to `MobileClient`.  Both `PushTask` (buffer-full path) and `Run`'s unregister handler previously called `close(client.send)` independently; a race between the two produced a double-close panic.  All close sites now use `client.closeOnce.Do(func() { close(client.send) })`.
- **T1** `internal/ml/telemetry.go`: Added `closeOnce sync.Once` to `TelemetryRecorder`.  `Close()` now calls `r.closeOnce.Do(func() { close(r.queue) })` so that calling `Close()` more than once no longer panics.
- **T2** `internal/ml/telemetry.go`: Removed the redundant `writer.Flush()` call from `Close()`.  `writeLoop` already performs a final flush after draining the queue and before signalling `done`; the second flush in `Close()` was both redundant and a potential source of confusion about which flush is authoritative.
- **P1** `internal/payment/htlc.go`: LND's gRPC-gateway REST layer encodes all `bytes` protobuf fields as standard base64, not hex.  All three HTLC operations (`CreateHoldInvoice`, `SettleHoldInvoice`, `CancelHoldInvoice`) were sending raw hex strings for `hash`, `preimage`, and `payment_hash` respectively, causing LND to reject every call with a 400 error.  Fixed by hex-decoding the caller's hex string to `[]byte` and then base64-encoding for the JSON body.  Added `encoding/base64` import; updated struct field comments to reflect the wire encoding.
- **R2** `configs/policies/resource_sharing.rego`: `allow_mobile_task` was calling `job_within_limits(input.job_spec)` while `mobile_eligible_task` reads from `input.task.*`.  The two different input-path conventions meant callers had to supply both `input.task` and `input.job_spec` or the rule always evaluated false.  Fixed by changing `allow_mobile_task` to call `job_within_limits(input.task)` so a single input object satisfies the entire rule.

**High fixes (ship-blocking):**

- **H3** `internal/httpapi/mobilehub.go`: `Run()` had no shutdown mechanism — the goroutine leaked on server stop.  Changed signature to `Run(ctx context.Context)` and added `case <-ctx.Done(): return` to the select loop.
- **R1** `configs/policies/resource_sharing.rego`: Added `input.node.class != ""` guard to `allow_mobile_task`.  Previously a caller could omit `input.node.class`, causing `task_replication_factor` to fall through to its default of 1 and silently bypass the shadow-replica requirement for `mobile-android` tasks.  Requiring the field to be non-empty forces callers to be explicit about the node class.
- **SC1** `internal/orchestration/scheduler.go`: The fallback `armIndex` for uniform random node selection used `int(time.Now().UnixNano()) % len(candidates)`.  On 32-bit platforms `int` is 32-bit; truncating a 64-bit nanosecond timestamp produces a value that can be negative, making the modulo result negative and causing a slice-index panic.  Fixed with unsigned arithmetic: `int(uint64(time.Now().UnixNano()) % uint64(len(candidates)))`.
- **SC3** `internal/orchestration/scheduler.go`: `ScheduleMobile` could silently overwrite an existing `ActiveWorkloads` entry for the same `WorkloadID` when a workload was retried concurrently.  Added an existence check under the write lock; if the workload is already active, the duplicate dispatch is logged and skipped.
- **SC5** `internal/orchestration/scheduler.go`: `RecordMobileOutcome` was building its telemetry event with an empty `workloadID` string (`""`), making outcome records uncorrelatable with their dispatch-time pending records in the JSONL file.  Added `workloadID string` as the first parameter; callers supply the parent workload ID.
- **B3** `internal/httpapi/mobilehub.go`: Added `UnregisterHook func(nodeDID string)` field to `MobileHub`.  `Run()`'s unregister case now calls `h.UnregisterHook(nodeDID)` (outside the hub lock) after removing a client.  Wire this to `bandit.RemoveArm(nodeDID)` at startup to prevent unbounded arm-matrix accumulation in `LinUCBBandit` (~9.8 KB per disconnected node).

**Medium fixes (correctness / security):**

- **F2** `internal/orchestration/mlfeatures.go`: Battery trend feature was computed as `n.Plugged && n.BatteryPct > 50`, incorrectly classifying a plugged-in device with low charge as draining.  A device is charging whenever it is plugged in, regardless of current charge level.  Fixed to `n.Plugged` alone (1.0 = plugged/charging, 0.0 = on battery/draining, 0.5 = no-battery/always-on).
- **T3** `internal/ml/telemetry.go`: `NewTelemetryRecorder` accepted arbitrary paths without validation.  A caller could supply `"../../etc/cron.d/evil"` and write outside the intended directory.  Added a `strings.Contains(path, "..")` guard that returns an error on traversal sequences.
- **T4** `internal/ml/telemetry.go`: `writeOne` silently discarded write and flush errors via `//nolint:errcheck`.  Disk-full or closed-file errors were invisible.  Replaced with explicit `log.Printf` error reporting so failures surface in logs without blocking the calling goroutine.
- **H5** `internal/httpapi/mobilehub.go`: `ServeWS` used a blocking send (`h.register <- client`) on the register channel.  If the hub's event loop fell behind, the HTTP handler goroutine would stall indefinitely.  Changed to a non-blocking select/default that closes the connection and logs a warning when the channel is full.
- **H6** `internal/httpapi/mobilehub.go`: `refreshLastSeen` took a hub-wide write lock to update a single timestamp, serialising all concurrent `ActiveNodes` calls during high-frequency heartbeat processing.  Replaced with a hub read lock (to locate the client) plus a per-client `seenMu sync.Mutex` (to update `LastSeen`), allowing concurrent map reads to proceed unimpeded.
- **SC4** `internal/orchestration/scheduler.go`: `assignWithReplication` generated the shadow workload ID as `workloadID + "_shadow"`.  Concurrent `ScheduleMobile` calls for the same workload ID produced identical shadow IDs, silently overwriting each other in `ActiveWorkloads`.  Added a nanosecond timestamp suffix: `workloadID_shadow_<UnixNano>`.
- **S1** `internal/httpapi/server.go`: `handleMobileRegister` accepted any `node_class` string without validation.  Unknown values propagated into the scheduler where they could cause missed replication-factor lookups.  Added validation against the four known `orchestration.NodeClass` constants; unknown values return HTTP 400.
- **S2** `internal/httpapi/server.go`: WebSocket (`/ws/nodes`) and REST (`/api/v1/nodes/mobile/register`) mobile endpoints had no rate limiting, allowing a single IP to exhaust goroutine and registration resources.  Added a per-IP sliding-window rate limiter (`ipRateLimiter`) using a `map[string]*rlBucket` with a 1-minute reset window; `/ws/nodes` limited to 30 req/min, `/register` to 20 req/min.  `clientIP()` respects `X-Forwarded-For` for reverse-proxy deployments.
- **R3** `configs/policies/resource_sharing.rego`: HTLC cancel/settle and mobile preempt operations had no OPA authorization rules, meaning the policy layer provided no enforcement boundary for payment lifecycle events.  Added `allow_htlc_cancel` (requires coordinator DID + valid cancel reason), `allow_htlc_settle` (requires coordinator DID + `shadow_verified == true`), and `allow_mobile_preempt` (requires coordinator DID + valid preempt reason) with explicit reason allowlists.
- **WA1** `internal/wasm/executor.go`: `timedExecutor.Execute` checked `ctx.Err()` (the parent context) instead of `tctx.Err()` (the timed child context).  This could produce false "timed out" results when the parent was cancelled for unrelated reasons, and could also miss genuine timeouts when the inner executor returned a non-context error concurrently with deadline expiry.  Fixed to check `tctx.Err()`, wrap with the new `ErrTimeout` sentinel via `%w`, and use `errors.Is` for detection.  Exported `ErrTimeout` so callers can distinguish timeout from other errors.
- **A2** `internal/notification/apns.go`: `providerToken` captured `now := time.Now()` after calling `mintJWT()`, making `tokenExpAt` slightly later than the `iat` claim inside the token.  On a slow system the skew could exceed APNs' tolerance.  Fixed by capturing `now` before `mintJWT(now)` and passing it as a parameter so both the `iat` claim and `tokenExpAt` use the identical timestamp.
- **A4** `internal/notification/apns.go`: APNs HTTP 410 Gone (permanently invalidated device token) was mapped to the same generic error as all other non-200 responses.  Callers could not distinguish stale tokens from transient failures and had no signal to purge the token from storage.  Added the exported `ErrDeviceTokenInvalid` sentinel; the `send()` helper wraps it with `%w` on 410 so callers can use `errors.Is(err, notification.ErrDeviceTokenInvalid)`.

**Low fixes (documentation):**

- **W1** `internal/orchestration/workload.go`: Added a doc comment to `WorkloadState` warning that its top-level fields (`WorkloadID`, `Status`, `DesiredReplicas`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`) are snapshot copies that can diverge from the embedded `*Workload` pointer after construction.  New code should read `WorkloadState.Workload.*` directly.
- **B4** `internal/ml/telemetry.go`: Added a doc comment to `RewardFor` clarifying that `OutcomePending` intentionally returns 0.0 and must NOT be passed to `LinUCBBandit.Update`.  Pending records exist only to capture dispatch-time feature vectors; the bandit is updated later via `RecordMobileOutcome` with a resolved outcome.

### Added — ML-Driven Scheduling (2026-03-02)

- `internal/ml/telemetry.go`: `TelemetryRecorder` — appends `SchedulerEvent` JSONL records to disk; captures node features, task features, chosen arm, and outcome for offline ML training; `EventBuilder` fluent API; `RewardFor()` reward function (HTLC settle → 0.8+speed bonus, completed → 0.6, error → 0.1, preempted/cancelled → 0.0)
- `internal/ml/bandit.go`: `LinUCBBandit` — online contextual bandit (disjoint LinUCB); per-arm A (d×d) and b (d) matrices; Gauss-Jordan matrix inverse; thread-safe; α-tunable exploration; new arms initialise as identity (maximum exploration)
- `internal/orchestration/mlfeatures.go`: `NodeFeatures()`, `TaskFeatures()`, `SystemFeatures()`, `BuildContext()`, `SystemState` struct — moved here from `internal/ml` to break import cycle (`orchestration→ml` and `ml→orchestration` would be circular); `clampF()` local helper
- `internal/orchestration/scheduler.go`:
  - `SetMLBandit(*ml.LinUCBBandit)` and `SetTelemetryRecorder(*ml.TelemetryRecorder)` setter methods
  - `ScheduleMobile` upgraded: segCount computed before selection; system state snapshot; LinUCB arm selection via shared task+system context; dispatch-time pending telemetry event; push-failure path penalises arm immediately
  - `RecordMobileOutcome()`: called asynchronously on task resolution — updates bandit reward model and appends resolved `SchedulerEvent` to JSONL telemetry
- `docs/research/ML_LOAD_BALANCING.md`: 755-line technical research report surveying RL (SAC), contextual bandits (LinUCB / NeuralLinear), GNNs (GAT), LSTM forecasting, anomaly detection (LSTM-AE + Isolation Forest), and federated learning for heterogeneous SOHO node scheduling; phased implementation roadmap (Phase 0–4)
