✅ Memory: 16 GB
✅ Storage: 512 GB NVMe SSD
✅ Hypervisor: Hyper-V installed and enabled
✅ Can offer: 2 VMs
```

**Step 2:** Calculate costs
```
Cost Breakdown (per hour):
  Power:        $0.038 (315W × $0.120/kWh)
  Cooling:      $0.000
  Depreciation: $0.000
  ───────────────────
  Total:        $0.038/hour = $27.36/month
```

**Step 3:** Suggest pricing
```
💰 Suggested Price: $0.019/hour ($13.68/month per VM)
   Profit Margin: 30% (competitive tier)

   Your Price: $0.019/hour
   Savings: 76% cheaper than AWS! 🎉

Estimated Monthly Financials:
  Revenue:  $27.36 (2 VMs × $0.019/hour × 720 hours)
  Costs:    $27.36
  ─────────────────
  Profit:   $0.00 (30% margin included in price)
```

**Step 4:** Generate configuration

## 🔧 If Issues Occur

### Wizard Won't Start

**Symptom:** Double-click does nothing

**Solutions:**
1. Right-click → "Run as Administrator"
2. Check Windows Defender (might block)
3. Check antivirus software
4. Run from Command Prompt to see errors:
   ```cmd
   cd path\to\build
   soholink-wizard.exe
   ```

### Detection Fails

**Symptom:** "System detection failed"

**This is OK!** Wizard will continue anyway. Some laptops don't have:
- Hyper-V (Windows Home edition)
- Virtualization enabled in BIOS
- Enough resources (< 4 cores or < 8 GB RAM)

Wizard will show warnings but complete setup.

### Missing Dependencies

**Symptom:** "Cannot find XYZ"

**Solution:** The wizard is self-contained. No dependencies needed!
If you see this, something went wrong with the build.
